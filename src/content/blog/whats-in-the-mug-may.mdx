## Drinking ☕️

It's low tide here in RI, and today we're drinking a big Space X mug with a homemade half-calf blend of City of Saints Denizen and BRCC's Just Decaf.

The espresso was prepared using:
- **Machine:** [Breville Duo Temp Pro](https://amzn.to/3pFk0NK)
- **Grind:** [Fine-ish (15/60)](https://amzn.to/3VVUFLC)
- **Water:** Distilled
- **Mineral supplement:** [Third Wave's Espresso Profile](https://amzn.to/3ptcpBT)
- **Basket:** Double-shot

The mineral supplement made this morning's coffee extra smooth.

## Thinking 🤔

What is the optimal amount of caffeine for productivity? What is the optimal way to intake caffeine for productivity?

I came across a [Business Insider article](https://www.businessinsider.com/science-of-why-caffeine-makes-you-productive-2014-5) explaining how coffee affects body chemistry and discovered related research on coffeeandhealth.org. Though some original links were broken, I used the [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) to locate studies examining caffeine's effects on both sociability and mental performance.

I'll be investigating these sources in the near future and hope to have a full-length article on coffee available soon.
