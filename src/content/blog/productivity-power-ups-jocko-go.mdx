## Role Model 💪

Jocko Willink is "a hardcore, badass, driven military legend. A Navy-Seal turned consultant, businessman, author, podcaster, and motivator." His Instagram features "pictures of his watch at 04:30 AM, reminding you to get up and get after it." Jocko sells consulting services, books, and top-notch outerwear (made in America) plus health and wellness products via the [Jocko Fuel Store](https://amzn.to/453e4OG).

## Tired-Wired 😳

The ideal energy drink delivers a sustainable, time-released energy boost without anxiety, jitters, or crashes. I struggled to find quality energy drinks, eventually succumbing to "cravings to over-indulge, drink too much, sabotage myself."

## Experimenting 🧑‍🔬

[Jocko Go](https://amzn.to/3OTpTBr) contains 95 mg of caffeine paired with Nootropics including Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Acetyl L-Carnitine, Theobromine, L-Theanine, Bacopa, Alpha-GPC, Choline Bitartrate, B-Vitamins, and Caffeine from Green Coffee. The product is sugar-free with Monk Fruit to sweeten the deal.

## Synergy ☯️

The supplement pairs well with [Ketone-IQ](https://amzn.to/3KB24M3) for optimal results. I recommend consuming no more than every other day.

I'm not a Doctor. Please consult a certified physician before trying a new supplement.
