## How It Started 🚀

Working Dev's Hero launched as a WordPress site with a simple mission: become a publication for tips, tricks, and tutorials. Write articles. Share insights. Help developers level up.

AI changed everything.

Developers no longer need to bookmark tutorial sites or wait for blog posts. They ask an AI assistant and get answers instantly, tailored to their exact situation. Learning on the fly has become standard practice.

## New Direction 🎯

This shift prompted a rethink of what Working Dev's Hero should become. Rather than competing with AI as an information source, we decided to embrace it as our core methodology. The focus is now entirely on AI-enabled development:

- **Full-Stack Product Development** — Building customer-facing applications with AI as a force multiplier
- **Operations & AI Integration** — Helping businesses overhaul internal processes to unlock AI's potential
- **Strategic Consulting** — Guiding organizations to leverage AI for maximum effectiveness

A new product is also in development (announcement coming soon).

## The Catalyst 💡

The idea to rebuild came from [a post by Lee Robinson](https://x.com/leerob/status/1999513884382597485) discussing how Cursor moved away from their CMS. The reasoning resonated—sometimes the best approach is to simplify, own your content directly, and leverage modern tooling.

Bobby had a little time between Christmas and New Years and had wanted to try Claude Code for a while. Then Anthropic announced a [Holiday 2025 usage promotion](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/13163666-holiday-2025-usage-promotion) with increased Claude limits. Perfect timing.

## Three Hours ⏱️

Downloaded Claude Code. Configured the Puppeteer MCP server. Gave it a straightforward task: inventory the current Working Dev's Hero WordPress site and copy over all pages, including every blog article verbatim.

Claude Code, powered by Opus 4.5, methodically crawled the existing site, extracted the content, and rebuilt everything in Astro—a modern static site generator that's fast, flexible, and developer-friendly. Navigation, blog posts, portfolio pages, services section, shop. All of it.

Three hours later: a fully functional, production-ready website matching the original content with a fresh, modern design.

## What This Means 🦸

This experience crystallized everything Working Dev's Hero has been thinking about. AI isn't just a tool for answering questions or generating boilerplate. It's a genuine collaborator capable of substantial, complex tasks.

The site you're reading right now is proof. Every page, every component, every line of CSS was either created or refined through conversation with Claude. The curved hero section, the purple gradient, the portfolio case studies—all emerged from back-and-forth dialogue about what to build.

But here's the thing: AI didn't do *everything*. The Printful integration for the shop, the contact form, and the newsletter subscription all required manual reintegration. These are the pieces that need human expertise—understanding third-party APIs, handling authentication flows, ensuring data actually gets to where it needs to go.

This is where you want a trusted partner. This is where you want Working Dev's Hero.

## Looking Forward 🔮

A single developer with the right AI tools can now accomplish what previously required a team. That's not about replacing people—it's about amplifying what's possible.

Working Dev's Hero is positioned to help others navigate this transition. Whether building a product, optimizing internal operations, or figuring out how AI fits into your workflow, we've been in the trenches.

The WordPress site served well. This new chapter, built on modern technology and powered by AI collaboration, feels like exactly where we need to be.
