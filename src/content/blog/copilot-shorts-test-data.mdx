## Overview

This brief tutorial demonstrates how TypeScript developers can efficiently generate test data using GitHub Copilot.

## Prerequisites

To implement this technique, you'll need:

- Visual Studio Code Insider's build
- Copilot Chat extension
- Copilot Nightly

## The Process

The workflow involves three straightforward steps:

1. **Locate your interface definition** and copy it from your codebase
2. **Open Copilot Chat** within your IDE
3. **Request test data generation** by asking: "Generate test data that matches this interface"

## Key Benefit

This method eliminates manual data creation for complex objects, saving you considerable time and effort during test preparation.

No more hand-crafting mock data for your unit tests!

## Conclusion

This technique provides a quick solution for TypeScript developers who need to rapidly generate realistic test data for large or complicated object structures.
