## Overview

This article provides guidance on using GitHub Copilot Chat to efficiently refactor TypeScript function signatures between synchronous and asynchronous patterns.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.80.1 or newer
- GitHub Copilot extension
- Copilot Chat extension installed

## The Technique

The process involves three straightforward steps:

1. Highlight the code block containing the function
2. Press `cmd + i` to launch the inline chat interface
3. Request that Copilot convert the function between async and sync formats

## Bidirectional Capability

The approach works in both directions—you can transform asynchronous functions into synchronous ones, or vice versa, making it adaptable to various refactoring scenarios.

## Example

**To make async:**
```
Hit cmd + i and ask: "Make this function async"
```

**To make sync:**
```
Hit cmd + i and ask: "Make this function synchronous"
```

## Target Audience

This tip specifically addresses TypeScript developers seeking efficient ways to manage function signature updates within their development workflow.
