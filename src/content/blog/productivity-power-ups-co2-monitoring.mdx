## Sleeping on the Job 🥱

Few things frustrate more than adequate sleep, caffeine consumption, and persistent tiredness. When workload exceeds available time, combating fatigue becomes challenging. Multiple factors influence energy levels, and afternoon slumps lack obvious causes. Sleep, diet, and exercise remain fundamental fatigue-fighting tools. Recently, internet discussions highlight indoor air ventilation as essential for wellness enhancement, performance improvement, and productivity gains. Scientific evidence demonstrates that indoor air quality significantly impacts cognitive function.

## Show Me the Data 🧑‍🔬

Inhaled air contains approximately 0.04% CO2. Exhaled air contains approximately 4% CO2. Indoor CO2 accumulates unless continuous fresh air circulation occurs.

Research establishes that elevated CO2 levels degrade cognitive performance substantially, causing fatigue, drowsiness, and dizziness. Studies demonstrated decreased proofreading accuracy and diminished decision-making abilities at CO2 levels exceeding 1000 PPM.

According to "Indoor CO2 concentrations and cognitive function: A critical review," approximately fifty percent of study participants showed reduced cognitive abilities when pure CO2 was introduced. However, negative performance effects proved more consistent in ventilation-manipulation studies, suggesting CO2 serves as a ventilation quality indicator rather than direct cognitive impairment cause.

Poor ventilation and elevated particulate matter levels hinder cognitive function. When CO2 concentration increased from 600-1000 PPM to 900-1200 PPM, researchers observed a negative 3.4-5.3% impact on BARS test accuracy. Another study documented 10-20% calculation speed decreases in monitored school environments. Increased ventilation combats particulate matter effects by preventing unsafe accumulation. "Lower CO2 levels indicate proper airflow and ventilation."

## CO2 Monitoring 📈

High-profile entrepreneurs including @levelsio and @marc_louvion have shared CO2 device photos and positive anecdotes regarding health and productivity improvements.

### [Qingping Air Quality Monitor Lite](https://www.amazon.com/Qingping-Monitor-Compatible-Temperature-Humidity/dp/B092HK4BB1/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2YE85H0D4QZ78&keywords=Qingping+Air+Quality+Monitor&qid=1704247068&sprefix=qingping+air+quality+monitor%2Caps%2C103&sr=8-4&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.18ed3cb5-28d5-4975-8bc7-93deae8f9840) ($76)

Features PM2.5, PM10, and CO2 monitoring with HomeKit integration. Cube-shaped design. Caveat: Amazon marks device as frequently returned; reviews suggest potential data harvesting concerns.

### [Aranet4 Home](https://www.amazon.com/Aranet4-Home-Temperature-Ink-Configuration/dp/B07YY7BH2W/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=3QRAWJ4TWQAYV&keywords=aranet4&qid=1704247988&sprefix=aranet4%2Caps%2C132&sr=8-1-spons&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.18ed3cb5-28d5-4975-8bc7-93deae8f9840&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1) ($169)

Features temperature monitoring, e-ink display, mobile app, and historical data. Battery life up to 5 years. Bluetooth only (no HomeKit; unavailable outside home). Simple, precise, long-lasting option. This is my current device choice.

### AirGradient ONE (Open-source)

Pre-assembled or DIY kit available. Monitoring capabilities include CO2, PM2.5, PM10, NOx, VOCs, relative humidity, and temperature. HomeKit integration available through open-source implementation. Requires technical experience for operation. Comprehensive solution with significant data depth.

## Open the Windows 🪟

Opening windows and increasing ventilation when CO2 levels exceed 1000 PPM proves crucial for maximizing productivity by reducing particulates and improving comfort.

Educational institution research recommends: equipping rooms with CO2, temperature, and relative humidity monitoring devices; providing additional ventilation when CO2 exceeds 1000 ppm; maintaining temperatures at 20-22C (winter) and 22-24C (summer); preventing moisture buildup while keeping humidity below 60% during winter (preferably above 40%); establishing daily window-opening routines; and using odorless cleaning agents to avoid dirty carpet pollution.

Research indicates proper airflow significantly reduces task completion times and improves accuracy. "Opening windows on both sides of occupied space establishes directional airflow" and eliminates accumulated particles.
