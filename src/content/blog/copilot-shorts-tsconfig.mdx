## Overview

TypeScript developers frequently receive `tsconfig.json` files containing embedded comments. Since JSON doesn't officially support comments, these files require special handling.

This quick tip shows how to leverage AI tools to remove these comments efficiently.

## Requirements

To implement this technique, you'll need:

- Visual Studio Code Insider's build
- GitHub Copilot Chat extension
- Copilot Nightly extension

## The Process

1. Select the configuration text in your editor
2. Open the Copilot Chat interface
3. Request comment removal: "Remove the comments from this JSON"

You can take this text, open chat, and just ask Copilot to remove the comments. Cool!

## Benefits

This approach produces cleaner, more standardized TypeScript configuration files without manual editing, making it particularly useful for developers managing multiple project configurations.
