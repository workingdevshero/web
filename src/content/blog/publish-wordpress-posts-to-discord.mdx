## Prerequisites ✅

To configure IFTTT to publish recent WordPress posts to Discord, you'll need:

- WordPress User with Two-Step Authentication
- Discord Server
- IFTTT Account

This setup takes 15 minutes or less.

## Steps 🥾

### Step 1: Create Application Password

Navigate to Users > Your Profile > New Application Password in WordPress. Name the password and copy the generated value for later use.

### Step 2: Configure AIOSEO Settings

Set the "Default Post Image Source" to "Featured Image" under AIOSEO > Social Networks > Facebook. This ensures Discord uses the post's featured image for preview.

### Step 3: Create IFTTT Applet

Log into IFTTT.com and create a new applet by clicking "Add" next to "If This."

### Step 4: Connect WordPress Integration

Search for WordPress in the integrations list and authorize the connection.

### Step 5: Set Trigger

Select "Any new post" as your trigger condition.

### Step 6: Configure Discord Action

Click "Add" next to "Then That" and connect your Discord channel. Select "Post a message to a channel" and remove "Post Content" from the message field to avoid truncation issues.

### Step 7: Test Integration

Create a new WordPress post or click "Check Now" in your IFTTT applet. A formatted message with the post title, featured image, and link should appear in your Discord channel.
