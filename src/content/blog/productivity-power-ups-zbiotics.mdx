## Good Times 😂

Drinking provides social enjoyment and relaxation. However, alcohol is toxic and excessive consumption creates hangovers that significantly impact productivity.

The question is: how can accomplished professionals balance drinking socially while minimizing next-day performance losses?

## Hangovers 😵

Hangovers stem from **acetaldehyde**—formed during alcohol metabolism—which is the culprit behind hangover symptoms. Acetaldehyde "binds to receptors in your brain, creates oxidative stress" causing nausea, vomiting, tremors, dizziness, and malaise.

The body's liver becomes overwhelmed processing acetaldehyde during heavy drinking.

## Solution 🧑‍🔬

[ZBiotics](https://amzn.to/3ZpxV8R) addresses this through genetically modified *B. subtilis* bacteria that produce acetaldehyde-breaking enzymes. The company conducted "years of rigorous safety testing" before market release.

## Our Experience 🦸

We recommend [ZBiotics](https://amzn.to/3ZpxV8R) as part of our personal toolkit. We suggest pairing it with additive-free tequila (anecdotal recommendation without scientific backing) and note the product's price is justified by opportunity costs—working extra hours versus recovering from hangovers.
