## Nose Picking 👃

What would you accomplish if you unlocked nearly 365 hours of extra time to query the world's most powerful large language model? According to the Department of Transportation's Volpe Center, "Americans drive their car almost an hour a day." This represents substantial available time instead of unproductive activities.

Self-driving cars will eventually provide tremendous productivity gains, but they remain unavailable for mainstream use. Meanwhile, modern vehicles equipped with hands-free technology enable safer AI assistant interactions while driving.

## Hey GPT 🗣️

Safety concerns prevent phone operation while driving. However, many contemporary vehicles support voice-controlled smartphone integration through systems like CarPlay.

McKay Wrigley, a prominent AI community figure, created an iOS shortcut enabling Siri-based ChatGPT queries. The "Hey GPT" shortcut permits accessing GPT-4 without manual device interaction. Users report asking questions like: "What is the difference between an LLC and an S Corp?", "When should I use SQL vs. NoSQL?" and "How does an autoregressive transformer work?"

Previously, Siri refused internet searches while driving. The ChatGPT shortcut circumvents this limitation, allowing nearly unrestricted questioning with audio responses.

## Setup 🏗️

**Step 1: Obtain API Access**

Separate from ChatGPT+ subscriptions, the OpenAI API requires independent registration and subscription via https://openai.com/pricing.

**Step 2: Generate API Key**

Create an API key through your Account page at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.

**Step 3: Install Shortcut**

Navigate to the [Hey GPT Shortcut on iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8bcc2979d6e34a3d90a48c3f77f96d68). Click "Get Shortcut," select "Set Up Shortcut," input your OpenAI API key, and click "Add Shortcut."

**Step 4: Optional GPT-4 Upgrade**

Edit the shortcut, changing the model parameter from `gpt-3.5-turbo` to `gpt-4` for advanced capabilities.

**Step 5: Usage**

Trigger Siri and say "Hey GPT." Respond to Siri's prompt with your query. This integrates seamlessly with CarPlay steering wheel controls.

Please always obey traffic laws and pay attention to the road. The shortcut enables enhanced search capabilities—responsible usage remains essential.
