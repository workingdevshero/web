## Scripting ✍️

I recently created a script to manipulate JSON and generate zip files from folder collections. Historically, platform-native scripting languages like bash (Linux/MacOS) or PowerShell (Windows) were used. However, these untyped languages present challenges: they lack cross-platform compatibility, are difficult to debug, and contain unfamiliar syntax patterns that reduce efficiency.

## Node ❌

Integrating Node.js scripts into non-Node projects requires substantial boilerplate setup. The approach demands a `package.json` file for dependency management, and installing dependencies creates a bloated `node_modules` folder in the project root. TypeScript configuration for Node.js requires additional effort. While global dependencies could theoretically bypass `package.json`, implicit dependency management creates issues for team collaboration and CI/CD environments. Node.js works well within Node-specific projects but isn't ideal for automating tasks across different project types.

## Python ❌

Python is commonly selected for project task automation due to its debuggability, dependency management, and cross-platform support. However, developers who prioritize type safety encounter limitations: "Python's type support isn't native to the language, and often isn't provided by package authors." For unfamiliar languages and packages, native type availability improves development speed by reducing documentation research time.

## Deno ✅

According to deno.land, Deno is "the easiest, most secure JavaScript runtime" and offers "the best developer experience without the learning curve."

Dependencies are defined by importing modules directly from URLs in files requiring them. Missing dependencies auto-detect and install automatically when scripts run. Native TypeScript support eliminates `tsconfig.json` configuration and CommonJS/ESM concerns. The ecosystem features strongly typed packages without additional setup. VS Code supports Deno debugging through the Deno extension; initialization requires running `Deno: Initialize Workspace Configuration`.
