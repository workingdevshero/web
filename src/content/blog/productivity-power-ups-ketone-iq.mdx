## Butt Kicking 🦵

For entrepreneurs seeking peak performance, the challenge lies in sustaining momentum beyond initial motivation. Beyond addressing fundamentals, how do high performers sustain energy through challenging periods, pushing past obstacles to accomplish more?

## Top Performers 🥇

Navy Seals, Tour de France cyclists, and brain coaches for top performers frequently use exogenous ketone products like Ketone-IQ. I discovered this product through the Huberman Lab podcast, hosted by Dr. Andrew Huberman from Stanford's neurobiology department.

I used Ketone-IQ for approximately one week with significant results. After taking a double dose, my mental performance dramatically improved, comparing my brain function to "race fuel performance" compared to standard options.

## Science 🧑‍🔬

The body generates energy by burning carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Glycogen (from carbohydrates) serves as the primary fuel source, followed by fat burning through ketosis, and finally amino acids from muscle protein as a last resort.

Exogenous ketone drinks induce ketosis without requiring fasting or dietary restrictions. Research demonstrates that ketosis improves focus, energy levels, reduces inflammation, and supports weight management. According to the study "On the Metabolism of Exogenous Ketones in Humans," these drinks represent "a practical, efficacious way to achieve ketosis."

The product claims ketones function as "a more efficient fuel that can produce more power while using less oxygen." Unlike fats, ketones cross the blood-brain barrier, fueling both brain and body simultaneously.
