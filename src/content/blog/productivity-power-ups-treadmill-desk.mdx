## Stop Slouching 🐒

Optimal work performance requires physical activity. According to the CDC, "being physically active can improve your brain health, help manage weight, reduce the risk of disease, strengthen bones and muscles, and improve your ability to do everyday activities."

Despite knowing exercise matters, many professionals cite busy schedules as barriers to consistent physical activity, treating time as an immovable constraint rather than a manageable resource.

## Modern Solutions 👨‍🔬

Modern problems require modern solutions. A treadmill desk offers a practical approach to incorporating exercise into your workday. Research demonstrates that "walking regularly has been shown to make people feel happier about work and life, boost creative thinking, and improve cognitive performance."

Notable technology professionals have adopted this approach. Cory House, a prominent React consultant, has maintained a treadmill desk setup for over eight years. Linus Torvalds, Linux creator, similarly uses one. The trend has gained significant Instagram popularity among content creators.

## Options ☑️

If you already have a treadmill, a [desk attachment with riser from VIVO](https://www.amazon.com/VIVO-Adjustable-Workstation-Handlebars-Stand-TDML3/dp/B09MSW15WZ/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=3TQ78B97JEBA2&keywords=treadmill+desk+attachment+vivo&qid=1707596076&sprefix=treadmill+desk+attachment+vivo%2Caps%2C111&sr=8-1-spons&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.18ed3cb5-28d5-4975-8bc7-93deae8f9840&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1) offers the most economical solution. Before purchasing, measure the distance between your treadmill arm supports and the arm circumference for each side. [Longer velcro straps](https://www.amazon.com/Reusable-Fastening-Adjustable-Multi-Purpose-Organizer/dp/B082Y3SQ2V/ref=sr_1_11?crid=25DCEVN6I7NMZ&keywords=velcro+straps+20+inch+long&qid=1707596813&sprefix=velcro+straps+20+%2Caps%2C113&sr=8-11) may be necessary if arm diameter exceeds a few inches.
