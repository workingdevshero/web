## Selling on AutoPilot ✈️

It's easier than ever to build a functional, automated, e-commerce store for selling products to people all over the world.

## How? 🤔

Traditional platforms like Shopify cost $39 per month, which is quite a bit of money for a store that's not bringing in any revenue. Custom solutions require significant development time and expertise, creating an unfavorable cost-benefit analysis. WordPress offers a cost-effective alternative.

## Planning Your Route 🗺️

Here's the recommended approach:

### Domain Names

Register through [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) at as little as $5.98 a year for .com domains with various top-level domain options.

### Web Hosting

Use Namecheap's EasyWP managed WordPress hosting. The Turbo plan costs $58.88 a year and includes SSL certificates. The Starter plan is $34.88 a year.

### Content Management Systems

WordPress is the CMS choice. Purchase premium themes from [Themeforest](https://themeforest.net/) ($30-$70 one-time). Popular themes include Roxeen and Avada.

### Payment Services

The WooCommerce plugin handles payment processing with no setup fees. Use Stripe as your payment gateway provider.

### Printing and Drop Shipping

[Printful](https://www.printful.com/) provides on-demand printing and fulfillment. Here's how it works: customers pay your store, you pay Printful for production costs, and you keep the difference as profit. Printful handles printing and shipping directly to end customers.

## Victory 🏁

This approach enables launching a professional e-commerce store within 24 hours. Consider additional steps like custom email addresses, mailing lists, and content publishing.

Total estimated startup cost: **Under $100**
