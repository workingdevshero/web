## Drinking ☕️

This month I'm enjoying French Toast flavored cold brew from Red Barn Coffee. Rather than traditionally flavored coffee, I opted for whole beans ground coarsely and steeped overnight using a Coffee Toddy maker.

The result yields a smooth, subtle maple delight that's highly caffeinated. Perfect timing as autumn approaches.

## Thinking 🤔

This month I've been thinking about information management and energy conservation for entrepreneurs.

"Time management is academic; people who build successful businesses are masters of the pragmatic art of energy management."

Information overload requires systematic organization. Overly strict or loose processes fail. Solopreneurs must manage energy, not just time. Single-tasking prevents overwhelm. To-do lists should contain only same-day completable tasks. Rest and recovery prevent burnout. Borrowing future energy through overwork creates "energy debt."

## Reflection 👀

I experienced summer exhaustion from over-commitment and underdelivery. Exhaustion hit after attempting AI-driven hyper-productivity without adequate time allocation. Three planned adjustments:

1. **Defer commitments thoughtfully** - Balance helping others with self-care by weighing opportunity costs
2. **Organize Todoist daily** - Limit scheduled items to achievable daily goals; manage inbox properly
3. **Post platform-natively** - Create content optimized for each social platform rather than linking externally, as algorithms throttle external-link content

Recovery and rest are essential complements to productivity tools like caffeine.
